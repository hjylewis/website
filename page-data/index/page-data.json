This post explores how to balance short-term delivery with long-term investments, and how to evaluate which tools or improvements will offer the greatest return."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/technical-migrations/","categorySlug":"/category/engineering-teams/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Technical Migrations – Making a new path in the woods","date":"2025-7-3","category":"Engineering Teams","description":"Learn how to safely migrate from old systems to new ones without disrupting users—using the metaphor of building a new path through the woods.

For years, Sprout engineering team got by with a scrappy homemade localization solution. While this solution served us for years, we were running into limitations more and more as the team and the application grew. In this post, I will outline some of those limitations and the steps we took to redesign our localization system to address those limitations."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/language-engineering-systems-ingrown/","categorySlug":"/category/engineering-teams/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Language and Engineering systems are ingrown","date":"2020-11-05","category":"Engineering Teams","description":"In some ways we can think about engineering systems in the same way linguists think about natural languages. Both can become ingrown and complex over time. How might we relate what we know about how \"simpler\" natural languages are formed to engineering teams and systems?"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"currentPage":0,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/","nextPagePath":"/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["329091279"],"slicesMap":{}}
